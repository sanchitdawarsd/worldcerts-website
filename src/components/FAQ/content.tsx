            <p>
              OpenCerts is an open source platform which education institutions can adopt for issuing certificates.
              Please contact your education instituteâ€™s administrative office for enquiries on whether your certificate
              was issued in the OpenCerts format.{" "}

        question: "Is my personal data safe on the blockchain?",
        answer:
          "Academic records of the certificate and personal data are not published on the blockchain. A hash is generated from the certificate and is used to prove that the certificate is legitimate. The process of computing the hash from the certificate is not reversible. Since the hash is the only information published into the blockchain, no personal information can be obtained from content on the blockchain.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is OpenCerts backed by blockchain technology?",
        answer:
          "Using blockchain, we can greatly reduce the barrier to entry of publishing cryptographically protected educational credentials, as compared to currently existing costly proprietary software. In addition, a public blockchain is owned and maintained by the community and is easily accessible by anyone. As a result, there is no need to run or maintain services to verify OpenCerts.",

        question: "Why use the Ethereum blockchain?",

        question: "How do I send my OpenCerts certificate to someone?",

      },
      {
        question: "Why can't I print the certificate?",
        answer:
          "Printing the certificate discards all the advanced cryptographic protections we have built into OpenCerts, hence printed certificates are not to be considered authentic.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I modify the OpenCerts file?",
        answer: "The modified certificate will fail validation and show up as having been tampered with.",

        question: "What does it mean by Signature?",
        answer: (
          <>
            In every properly issued OpenCerts certificate file, there is a hash-based message authentication code which
            cryptographically certifies that the content of the certificate has not been altered. If you would like to
            know more about the technical nitty-gritty of how this works, check out our{" "}

        question: "What does it mean by Unascertained Issuer?",
        answer:
          "OpenCerts has to maintain a list of identified issuing institutes in order to detect fraudulent issuing institutes masquerading as legitimate ones. At this point in time, it is not unlikely that a legitimate issuing institute is not on our list of recognised institutions. If you are sure that your certificate is from a legitimate issuer, contact the institute directly.",

        question: "What does it mean by Revoked?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is this safe to use? Can't anyone just copy my certificate file and pass off as me?",
        answer:
          "Yes, the certificate file can trivially be duplicated. However, the recipient's name in the certificate cannot be altered without failing our verification process. Thus it is extremely important that the person doing the verification ensures that the recipient indicated in the certificate is actually the entity presenting the certificate. For more advanced institutions, there is the possibility of using Distributed IDs to associate the certificate recipient's public key for further authentication using public/private key signing in the future.",
