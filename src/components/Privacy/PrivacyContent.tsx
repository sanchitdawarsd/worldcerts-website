        This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use that accompany the applicable service you
        are requesting from us (the &#34;Service&#34;). In this Privacy Policy, &#34;Public Sector Entities&#34; means
        the Government (including its ministries, departments and organs of state) and public authorities (such as
        statutory boards).
      </div>

        <li>
          Insofar as the Service consists of or is provided to you through a website, please note that:
          <ol>
            <li>
              We may use &#34;cookies &#34;, where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track
              information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the
              number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this cookie
              can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
              usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking
              full advantage of the website.

          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          We may request certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of the Service. The data
          that may be requested include those identified in the Annex herein. Your data may be stored in our servers,
          systems or devices, in the servers, systems or devices of our third party service providers or collaborators,
          or on your device, and may be used by us or our third party service providers or collaborators to facilitate
          your access or use of the Service. We or our third party service providers or collaborators may collect system
          configuration information and/or traffic information (such as an IP address) and/or use information or
          statistical information to operate, maintain or improve the Services or the underlying service of the third
          party service provider or collaborator. For the avoidance of doubt, in this Privacy Policy, a reference to a
          third party service provider or collaborator includes other third parties who provide a service or collaborate
          with our third party service provider or collaborator.
